Polyaxon provides an abstraction called ‘metrics’ which is used for internal monitoring, generally timings and various counters. 
The default backend `noop` simply discards them.

This guide will help you set up a statsd backend to sends these metrics.

## Using the default Helm metrics deployment

Polyaxon provides a built-in statsd exporter in the Helm chart that can be enabled, the backend will be configured automatically.

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: true
```

## Using a custom backend

```yaml
externalServices:
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    backend: statsd
    options: {host: host, port: 8125}
```
