Polyaxon provides an abstraction called `metrics` which is used for internal monitoring, generally timings and various counters. 
The default backend `noop` simply discards them.

To enable tracing for Polyaxon EE Control Plane, you can use Jaeger, which is a popular choice for request tracing.

## Make sure the default Helm metrics deployment is disabled

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: false
```

## Set the external service 

```yaml
externalServices:
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    backend: jaeger
    options:
```
