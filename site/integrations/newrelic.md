Polyaxon provides an abstraction called `metrics` which is used for internal monitoring, generally timings and various counters. 
The default backend `noop` simply discards them.

This guide will help you set up to a [New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com/) backend to sends these metrics.

## Make sure the default Helm metrics deployment is disabled

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: false
```

## Set the external service

Add instrumentation and send Polyaxon metrics emitted to the New Relic.

```yaml
externalServices:
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    backend: newrelic
    options:
      license_key:
```
