Polyaxon provides an abstraction called `metrics` which is used for internal monitoring, generally timings and various counters. 
The default backend `noop` simply discards them.

This guide will help you set up to a [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) backend to sends these metrics.

## Make sure the default Helm metrics deployment is disabled

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: false
```

## Set the external service

Send Polyaxon metrics emitted to the Datadog REST API over HTTPS.

```yaml
externalServices:
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    backend: datadog
    options:
      api_key:
      app_key:
      tags: {}
```


## Using the DogStatsD Backend

Use the DogStatsD backend requires a [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) to be running with the DogStatsD backend.

```yaml
externalServices:
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    backend: datadog-statsd
    options:
      statsd_host:
      statsd_port: 8125,
      tags: {}
```
